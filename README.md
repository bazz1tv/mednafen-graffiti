Graffiti Netplay Enhancement
============================

Graffiti allows you to draw on the surface of your game. It can be used locally
or during netplay. It is intended to be a fun addition to the netplay experience.

Try it out
==========

First you'll need a binary of this software. That likely means you'll have to build it yourself. See the **Building** section below.

Once you've opened a ROM up (eg. `mednafen mario.smc`), you can immediately begin testing the graffiti feature! Now, it's most fun with a friend online, but you can run it locally too.

### Testing locally

First, press 't' to get a console prompt, then type `/g on` to enable graffiti mode. Now, when your mouse is over the game screen, you see a black square. You can now do the following:

- Left-Click and Drag: Draw
- Mouse Wheel: Change brush size
- Right-Click and Drag: Erase

### Playing Online

Make sure that both you and your buddy have Graffiti, and an identical copy of the game you're gonna play. Once you open the rom up, press 't' to get a console prompt, then type `/connect` to connect to mednafen's server. Once connected, the graffiti feature will automatically become activated. Once your friend joins the game, you can use 't' to chat with each other, and also have fun playing with graffiti together!

Building
========

Build Graffiti the same way as you would normally build mednafen. If you're unsure, it's probably with the following commands from the project directory:

```
./configure
make
sudo make install
```
